# Web-scrapper

##A simple web scrapper using BeautifulSoup

This implementation of web scrapper can scrap across all pages of http://oceanofgames.com/ and will list all the games currently available for download in the form of a CSV file. The script also uses threads in order to scrap multiple pages simultaneously so as to make the final process faster.

The CSV file contains details such as the title, RAM required, HDD Space required etc.
